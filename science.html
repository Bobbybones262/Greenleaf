    <h2>How Cannabis Affects the Body and Brain</h2>
    <p>Cannabis contains hundreds of chemical compounds called cannabinoids. The two most well-known are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol):</strong> The main psychoactive component that produces the "high". It binds to cannabinoid receptors in the brain.</li>
      <li><strong>CBD (Cannabidiol):</strong> Non-psychoactive, known for potential therapeutic benefits like reducing anxiety and inflammation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Endocannabinoid System</h3>
    <p>The human body has an endocannabinoid system (ECS) which regulates mood, appetite, pain sensation, memory, and more. Cannabis cannabinoids interact with ECS receptors, influencing these functions.</p>
    <h3>Effects on the Brain</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Euphoria, relaxation, altered perception (mostly THC)</li>
      <li>Reduced anxiety and seizures (CBD)</li>
      <li>Impaired short-term memory and coordination (THC)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Medical Research</h3>
    <p>Cannabis is being studied for treatment of chronic pain, epilepsy, PTSD, multiple sclerosis, and cancer-related symptoms. More research is ongoing to fully understand benefits and risks.</p>
